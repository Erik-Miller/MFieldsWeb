				h3 Attention Hunters
				p.italic Effective Immediately! 
				p Due to extensive remodeling of our sausage rooms (we are adding more smokehouses), and inspection rules pertaining to our daily operations, Miesfeld's Market will not be able to skin or cut deer or other wild game the entire 2016-2017 season. We apologize for the inconvenience! We will be accepting all boneless wild game trim for making our award winning sausage items or for grinding hamburger. To show our appreciation to those who have had their wild game processed here in the past, we will give you a coupon for $5.00 off of your wild game order for 30 â€”50 pounds of trim or a $10.00 coupon for over 50 pounds brought in. (coupon good on venison sausage items only) 
				p If you are looking for someone reputable in the area to skin and cut your deer we suggest: Jerry Shedal 920-726-4809 (Newton) or Rick Rogers 920-564-2169 (Oostburg). If you have any questions please call Tracy 920-565-6328.
